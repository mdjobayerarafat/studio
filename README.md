## Images

*(Due to the limitations of this environment, images of the web app pages and functions cannot be displayed here. Please run the application locally to view the user interface.)*

Here are some descriptions of potential key pages and functions based on the file structure:

*   **Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`):** Likely the main landing page of the application, potentially displaying a dashboard or overview of tasks and routines.
*   **Routine Management:** Pages or components for creating, viewing, and managing routines (`src/components/routine`). This could involve displaying `RoutineCard` elements and using `CreateRoutineDialog`.
*   **Task Management:** Pages or components for creating, viewing, and managing tasks (`src/components/task`). This might involve using `CreateTaskDialog`, `TaskDisplay`, and `TaskFormFields`.
*   **Todo List:** A section or page dedicated to managing a todo list (`src/components/todo`). This could include features for adding todos (`AddTodoForm`), displaying items (`TodoItemRow`), and potentially using the AI-powered refinement feature (`RefineTodoItemDialog`).
