## Core Features:

- Routine Creation: The app offers users a straightforward method to create routines by combining a series of tasks to be executed automatically.
- Time-based Activation: Tasks can be activated based on a specific time of day.
- Geofence Activation: Tasks can be activated when the user virtually enters or leaves a geographical area defined by their coordinates.
